The Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Project combines film critique with data science by analyzing the emotional tone of movie reviews. 
Participants will collect reviews from platforms like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, then apply sentiment analysis techniques to categorize them as positive, 
negative, or neutral. Using natural language processing (NLP) tools, the project will identify key emotional trends and correlations with aspects such 
as plot, acting, and direction.

Key goals include:

Data Collection: Gather diverse movie reviews for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: Classify reviews by emotional tone and identify specific feelings like joy, anger, or excitement.
Visualization: Present insights through graphs, word clouds, and heatmaps.
Comparative Insights: Compare audience and critic sentiments to uncover patterns and trends.
